## üìÇ Dataset Contents

This dataset contains pre-simulated data required to generate the plots presented in the accompanying paper. The folder contents are as follows:

1. **`BEM_canonical`** ‚Äî Cross-correlation weights based on the Binocular Energy Model (see Supplementary Figure 4).
2. **`checkpoint`** ‚Äî Pretrained GC-Net model.
3. **`CMM`** ‚Äî Cross-correlation and cross-matching responses to RDSs (see Figure 3).
4. **`epoch_7_iter_22601`** ‚Äî GC-Net outputs (see Figures 4 & 5).
5. **`MVPA`** ‚Äî Decoding results (see Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 1 & 2).
6. **`rds`** ‚Äî Generated RDS stimuli used for simulation (general use).
7. **`S2N`** ‚Äî fMRI percent signal change (see Supplementary Figure 3).
8. **`VTC_extract_smoothed`** ‚Äî Smoothed VTC data exported from Brainvoyager (general use).
9. **`VTC_normalized`** ‚Äî Normalized VTC data (general use).
10. **`VTC_stimID`** ‚Äî Stimulus parameters corresponding to the VTC data (general use).
11. **`wavelet`** ‚Äî Wavelet analysis data (see Supplementary Figure 5).

## üêç Python Code Repository

Refer to `folder_tree_structure.txt` for a complete layout of the folder hierarchy.

The parent folder (which contains the cloned `CMM_model` repository) is organized into three main directories:

* `Codes/`
* `Data/`
* `Plots/`

### Data Setup

Please move the following dataset folders into the `Data/` directory:

* `BEM_canonical`
* `CMM`
* `MVPA`
* `rds`
* `S2N`
* `VTC_extract_smoothed`
* `VTC_normalized`
* `VTC_stimID`
* `wavelet`

### GC-Net Outputs

Create the following directory:

```
Codes/Python/gcnet/results/sceneflow/monkaa/shift_1.5_median_wrt_left
```

Then, move the following folders into that newly created directory:

* `checkpoint`
* `epoch_7_iter_22601`
